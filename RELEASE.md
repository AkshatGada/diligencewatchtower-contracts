## [1.0.0] Public Release

> Description
Welcome to the public release of our Witness Chain Rollup Watchtower contracts! This marks another milestone in our watchtower development, demonstrating our progress for the now thriving community of node operators on EigenLayer. This offering remains whitelist-based. We're excited to share our progress with the community.

### Breaking Changes
* The newer version of the Witnesschain watchtower works only with the newer and upgraded WitnessChain contracts, some of which now lie on WitnessChain's own ZK L2 chain powered by Polygon CDK for gas cost savings
* Many config parameters have been renamed/added/removed, thus making old configurations unusable with this new release

### New Features
#### Watchtower
* Introduction of a new type of commitment by watchtower, the Inclusion Proofs
* Watchtowers now submit bounty claims for Inclusion Proofs
* The proofs of diligence are now submitted on ZK-L2 for gas cost savings
* The proofs of inclusion are now batched and submitted on ZK-L2 for gas cost savings
* Configurable network choice to watch base or optimism permissionlessly
